# üß† Research Projects Database

This SQL project models a **Research Projects Management System** using relational databases and follows an Entity-Relationship (ER) schema. The database maintains records of research projects, employees, project managers, and funding agencies.

## üóÉÔ∏è Key Features

- Tracks research projects with their **name, duration, budget, manager**, and **funding agency**.
- Supports **multiple employees per project** (many-to-many relationship).
- Associates **each project with a single manager** (who is also an employee).
- Links **each project to one funding agency**.
- Ensures **data integrity** using primary and foreign keys.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tables Included

1. **Employee**: Contains employee details (SSN, name, salary).
2. **FundingAgency**: Stores information about funding agencies (name, address).
3. **Project**: Stores project details (name, budget, duration).
4. **Project_Manager**: Associates each project with a single employee who manages it.
5. **Employee_Project**: A junction table showing which employees are working on which projects.
